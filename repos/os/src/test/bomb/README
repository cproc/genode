This test utility is supposed to starts as many components as configured and
resources permit. It is kind of a fork bomb to stress test core, init, and
of course the kernel.

The master component (bomb-master) starts a given number of children and
donates the available memory in equal shares to the children. The children
themselves start new children until they all memory is consumed or a given
depth (called bomb generation) has been reached. The bomb master starts
killing all children after a given period of time and restarts the creation
process.


Configuration
-------------

! ...
! <config rounds="1" generations="1" children="2" sleep="2000" demand="1048576"/>
! ...

rounds:      solely used by master bomb - number of start/kill rounds
generations: maximum generations of children, i.e. tree depth, to create
children:    number of children per generation of a bomb parent to create
sleep:       time in ms to wait between creation and killing of children by
             bomb-master
demand:      amount of RAM in Bytes which are required to spawn a new child

The values given in the example config snippet above specified the default
parameters, if the XML attributes are not set explicitly in the bomb config.
