This directory contains an experimental loader service, which allows
for the instantiation of subsystems via a service. The resources for
the new subsystem are provided by the client when opening the session.
Except for the lifetime of the subsystem, however, the client has no
control over the functioning of the subsystem.

Note that this is an experimental implementation crafted for the
browser plugin mechanism presented at the 2010-10 Live CD. But the
service will eventually evolve to become a generally useful tool.
