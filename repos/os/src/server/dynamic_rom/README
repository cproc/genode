ROM service that provides ROM modules that change during the lifetime of a ROM
session according to a timeline. This main purpuse of this service is the
testing of programs that are able to respond to ROM module changes, for example
configuration changes.

For a practical example, refer to the 'gems/run/decorator.run' script.
