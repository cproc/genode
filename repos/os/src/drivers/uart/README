This driver operates the UARTs on the given platform. It provides the
'Terminal_session' interface for output via serial line.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server supports the following configuration options, supplied
via Genode's config mechanism.

:Routing clients to specific UARTs:

  Depending on the underlying hardware platform, the UART server is
  configurable to route specific clients to distinct UARTs. There is
  no default routing, so the configuration is mandatory. UART 0 is
  assumed to be used by the kernel and, therefore, left untouched.

  ! <config>
  !   <policy label="test-uart1" uart="1" />
  !   <policy label="test-uart2" uart="2" />
  !   <policy label="test-uartx" uart="1" />
  ! </config>
