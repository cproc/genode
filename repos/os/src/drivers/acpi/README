This directory contains an implementation of a simple ACPI parser

Behavior
--------

This server should be used when using a kernel (like Fiasco.OC or Nova) that
takes advantage of x86's APIC. The server traverses the ACPI tables and sets the
interrupt line of devices within the PCI config space to the GSIs found in the
ACPI tables. The 'MADT' table is parsed by the server as well, enabling clients
to use the correct IRQ when 'Interrupt Override' structures are found wihtin the
table.

Usage
-----

Start the 'acpi_drv' in your Genode environment. Do not start the 'pci_drv'
since this will be used as a slave of the 'acpi_drv'. You still must load the
'pci_drv' in your boot loader.

Configuration snipped (please note that IRQ service requests of the 'timer' are
routed to the ACPI-driver):

!<start name="acpi">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!    <binary name="acpi_drv"/>
!    <provides>
!      <service name="PCI"/>
!      <service name="IRQ" />
!    </provides>
!    <config>
!      <policy label="acpi_drv">
!        <pci class="ALL"/>
!      </policy>
!    </config>
!    <route>
!      <any-service> <parent/> <any-child /> </any-service>
!    </route>
!</start>
!
!<start name="timer">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!  <provides><service name="Timer"/></provides>
!  <route>
!    <service name="IRQ"><child name="acpi" /></service>
!    <any-service> <parent /> <any-child /></any-service>
!  </route>
!</start>

The 'config' node on the 'acpi_drv' requires and entry that permits the
'acpi_drv' to iterate over all pci devices in order to rewrite the
interrupt numbers according to the 'MADT' table. Furthermore the whole 'config'
node will be passed on the 'pci_drv' which requires policy entries for each
client separately. Read the 'pci_drv' README for more details.
