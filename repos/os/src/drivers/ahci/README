This directory contains the implementation of Genode's AHCI driver

Behavior
--------

The driver run on x86 32/64 bit platforms while also supporting the Exynos5
SOC. If more than one AHCI controller are present, the first one will be used.
Each active device on each AHCI port will be represented by a Genode block
session. The server must be configured via a policy, that states which client
can access a certain device:


!<start name="ahci">
!  <binary name="ahci_drv" />
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M" />
!  <provides><service name="Block" /></provides> }
!  <route>
!    <any-service> <parent /> <any-child /> </any-service>
!  </route>
!  <config>
!    <policy label="test-ahci" device="0" />
!    <policy label="bench" device="1" />
!  </config>
!</start>

In the example above, the test-ahci program gains access to device 0, while the
benchmark program gains access to device 1.
