This VFS plugin offers access to Genode's 'Capture' session.

It provides a file named "capture", with the captured
pixel data with 4 bytes per pixel (ARGB) and a file named
".capture/info" which contains the width and height of the
capture area in XML format, which must also be passed in the
VFS plugin configuration:

<capture width="..." height="..."/>
