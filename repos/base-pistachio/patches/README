This directory contains patches for the Pistachio microkernel

:'syscalls_ia32.patch':

 GCC 4.6 switches from base-pointer-relative addressing to stack-pointer-
 relative addressing for memory-input constraints of inline assembler. Therefore
 the syscall bindings are adapted to these requirements.

Applying the patches
--------------------

To apply a patch to the Pistachio kernel, use the 'patch' command. First check
the directory given at the header of the patch. It may contain a directory
prefix (such as 'a/'), which does not actually exist. This prefix is usually
generated by the tool used to create the patch. In this case, use the '-p'
option of the patch command. To apply the patch with the first part of the
path stripped, issue the following command (make sure that you changed to
the base directory of the Pistachio kernel):

! patch -p1 < /path/to/utcb.patch
