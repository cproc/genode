This directory contains patches for the Nova Hypervisor prerelease 0.3

:'utcb.patch':

  It is not possible to destroy UTCBs in NOVA 0.3. Therefore UTCBs cannot be
  re-used which may lead to the exhaustion of contexts within Genode. This patch
  simply causes NOVA to ignore this issue.


Applying the patches
--------------------

To apply a patch to the NOVA hypervisor, use the 'patch' command. First check
the directory given at the header of the patch. It may contain a directory
prefix (such as 'a/'), which does not actually exist. This prefix is usually
generated by the tool used to create the patch. In this case, use the '-p'
option of the patch command. To apply the patch with the first part of the
path stripped, issue the following command (make sure that you changed to
the base directory of the NOVA hypervisor):

! patch -p1 < /path/to/utcb.patch
