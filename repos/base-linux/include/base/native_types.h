	 * In a previous version, we have relied on POSIX semaphores as provided by
	 * the glibc. However, relying on the glibc badly interferes with a custom
	 * libc implementation. The glibc semaphore implementation expects to find
	 * a valid pthread structure via the TLS pointer. We do not have such a
	 * structure because we create threads via the 'clone' system call rather
	 * than 'pthread_create'. Hence we have to keep the base framework clean
	 * from glibc usage altogether.
