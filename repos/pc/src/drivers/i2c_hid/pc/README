This driver support I2C HID devices connected to Intel Tigerlake/Alderlake
LPSS I2C controllers.

Configuration
-------------

Some properties of the used device must be configured via '<config>'
attributes as the default configuration is tailored to Fujitsu LIFEBOOK
U7411 with Synaptics touchpad.

:gpio_pin: Touchpads are connected to a GPIO pin in interrupt mode to
  request input-event handling.

:bus_addr: The I2C bus address of the concrete controllers differs among
  touchpad manufacturers and can be adjusted via this attribute.

:hid_addr: The I2C register address of the HID descriptor is reflected via
  ACPI device-specific methods (which are not supported yet) and can be
  explicitly configured with this attribute.

The default configuration is like follows.

! <config gpio_pin="266" bus_addr="44" hid_addr="32"/>
