This component implements a CPU service which samples the instruction pointer
of the configured threads on a regular basis for the purpose of statistical
profiling.

The collected samples are written to the LOG session with an individual label
for each thread. By using the 'fs_log' component, the sample data can be
written into separate files if desired.

Configuration options
---------------------

<config sample_interval_ms="100" sample_duration_s="1">
	<policy label="init -> test-cpu_sampler -> ep" />
</config>

The 'sample_interval_ms' attribute configures the time between two samples in
milliseconds.

The 'sample_duration_s' attribute configures the overall duration of the
sampling activity in seconds.

The policy configures the threads to be sampled.

The clients of the CPU sampler component must be at least grand children of the
initial init process to have their CPU session routed accordingly. An example
configuration using a sub-init process can be found in the 'cpu_sampler.run'
script.
