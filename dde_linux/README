Device drivers ported from the Linux kernel

USB
###

HID
~~~

Supports keyboard and mouse. A run script can be found under 'run/usb_hid.run'.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="3M"/>
!  <provides><service name="Input"/></provides>
!  <config>
!    <hid/>
!  </config>
!</start>

Note: It has been observed that certain 1.0 versions of Qemu do not generate
mouse interrupts. The mouse driver should work correctly on Qemu 1.0.93 and
above.

STORAGE
~~~~~~~

Currently supports one USB storage device. Hot plugging has not been tested. A
run script can be found under 'run/usb_storage.run'.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!  <provides> <service name="Block"/> </provides>
!  <config><storage /></config>
!</start>
