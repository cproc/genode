This repository contains the Qt5 toolkit f√ºr Genode

Qt5 is a tool kit for developing platform-independent applications. It
comprises a complete platform-abstraction layer and a rich GUI tool kit.
With this repository, native Qt5 applications can be compiled and
natively executed for the Genode OS Framework. This way, Qt5 becomes
available on all base platforms supported by Genode.

Usage
-----

For using Qt5 for your Genode applications, you first need to download and
prepare the original Qt5 source codes and build a few Qt5 tools such as
the meta-object compiler (moc) and the resource compiler. The top-level
makefile found in this directory automates this task. Just issue:

! make prepare

To include the 'qt5' repository into the Genode build process,
add the 'qt5/' directory to the 'REPOSITORIES' declaration of the
'etc/build.conf' file within your build directory.

Qt5 depends on the 'libports' repository, specifically on the 'freetype2'
and 'jpeg' libraries. Please make sure that you called the top-level
Makefile of the 'libports' repository for those preparing those libraries
and that your 'REPOSITORIES' declaration contains the 'libports' repository.
